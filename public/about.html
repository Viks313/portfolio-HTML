  I'm a driven and enthusiastic full-stack web developer with two years of
  experience crafting engaging and dynamic web applications. My expertise spans
  the entire development spectrum, from front-end design to back-end logic,
  enabling me to bring projects to life from concept to completion.

  My skillset includes a strong foundation in core web technologies like HTML,
  CSS, and JavaScript. I'm adept at building responsive and user-friendly
  interfaces using React, a powerful JavaScript library, and I'm comfortable
  working with TypeScript to enhance code maintainability and scalability. I'm a
  strong advocate for version control and have extensive experience using Git
  and GitHub for collaborative development and project management. My ability to
  work independently and as part of a team makes me a valuable asset to any
  project.
